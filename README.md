**CMDR-IAD: Cross-Modal Mapping and Dual-Branch Reconstruction for 2D–3D Industrial Anomaly Detection**

This repository provides the official PyTorch implementation of **CMDR-IAD**, an unsupervised framework for industrial anomaly detection that integrates RGB appearance and 3D surface geometry.  
The method is lightweight, does not rely on memory banks or teacher–student architectures, and supports multimodal (2D+3D) as well as single-modality (2D-only or 3D-only) settings.

## 📌 Overview

Multimodal industrial anomaly detection benefits from combining complementary RGB and 3D information. However, existing unsupervised approaches often depend on memory banks, teacher–student schemes, or fragile fusion strategies, which can degrade performance under noisy depth, weak texture, or missing modalities.

**CMDR-IAD** addresses these challenges through:
- **Bidirectional 2D↔3D cross-modal mapping** to model appearance–geometry consistency
- **Dual-branch reconstruction** to independently capture normal appearance and geometric patterns
- **A reliability- and confidence-aware fusion strategy** for robust and precise anomaly localization

## Introduction
CMDR-IAD: 2D–3D Industrial Anomaly Detection

CMDR-IAD is a lightweight, unsupervised framework for detecting industrial defects using RGB images and 3D data. It learns cross-modal feature mappings and uses dual-branch reconstruction to capture normal appearance and geometry patterns.

Key Features

Cross-modal mapping between 2D and 3D feature spaces.

Dual-branch reconstruction for RGB and 3D features.

Adaptive fusion emphasizes reliable signals and suppresses noisy regions.

Low memory footprint and fast inference using frozen encoders and lightweight networks.

Supports 3D-only operation when RGB images are unavailable.

Performance

State-of-the-art anomaly detection and localization on MVTec 3D–AD.

Efficient in memory and speed compared to existing multimodal methods.

Works in both standard and few-shot settings.

## Datasets

We evaluate CMDR-IAD on the **[MVTec 3D-AD](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-3d-ad)** dataset, which provides paired RGB images and 3D point clouds for industrial anomaly detection.

The raw dataset requires preprocessing to obtain aligned RGB images and organized point clouds. The necessary preprocessing scripts are provided in the `processing` directory.



## 📦 checkpoints

We release the pretrained CMDR-IAD checkpoints used to obtain the results reported in the paper.
The weights are provided per object category and can be directly used for inference.

## Code
To train CMDR-IAD, use the train.py script.
The training procedure independently optimizes the cross-modal mapping networks and the dual-branch reconstruction modules for a given object category, following the protocol described in the paper.
Training command
python train.py --class_name tire

Training options

--dataset_path : Path to the root directory of the MVTec 3D-AD dataset.

--checkpoint_savepath : Directory where trained checkpoints will be saved (default: ./checkpoints/CMDR_IAD_checkpoints).

--class_name : Object category to train on.

--epochs_no : Number of training epochs.

--batch_size : Batch size.

Each object category is trained independently, and the resulting checkpoints are stored per class.
